<p>Techfugees Australia is the tech community's response to the current refugee crisis involving a network of concerned individuals who want to help refugees settle happily and more quickly into the Australian community.
We’re part of a global movement that started in late 2015 with dozens of events now held around the world. In Australia, we’ve held two events, the first in Sydney (November 2015) and then in Melbourne (April 2016). Many of the solutions developed are now operating as tech start-ups in their own right.
Our next Hackathon will focus specifically on hacking the challenges faced by young people (~16 to 24). Of course if you’re older than that we’re still keen for you to participate!
Once again, we will bring together developers, designers, entrepreneurs and community members to develop creative tech solutions. It doesn’t matter if you’ve never been to a Hackathon everyone is welcome and you’ll have tons of fun while learning new skills and meeting lots of great people.
Hacker Teams will develop tech solutions for young refugee settlement challenges articulated by our partners including Settlement Services International (SSI) the largest not-for-profit humanitarian settlement organisation in Australia.</p>
